    <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>This is a spicy sauce similar to etouffee. By adding seafood, 
           it becomes Seafood Creole.</p> 
       

     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <p>Yields 6 servings</p>
       
       <ul>
         <li>¾ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
         <li>½ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
         <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves </li>
         <li>½ teaspoon dried sweet basil </li>
         <li>¼ cup butter</li>
         <li>1 cup peeled chopped tomato</li>
         <li>¾ cup chopped onion </li>
         <li>¾ cup chopped celery </li>
         <li>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper </li>
         <li>1½ teaspoons minced garlic </li>
         <li>1¼ cups chicken stock </li>
         <li>1 cup canned tomato sauce </li>
         <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®) </li>
         <li>2 bay leaves</li>
         <li>1 pound peeled and deveined rock shrimp (thawed if frozen) </li>
         <li>1 pound bay scallops (thawed if frozen) </li>
         <li>1 pound haddock fillets (thawed if frozen) - cut into bite-size pieces </li>
       </ul>

     <h4>Steps</h4>
       <ol>
          <li>Mix together oregano, salt, white pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 
              thyme, and basil in a small bowl; set aside.</li> 
          <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; stir in tomato, 
              onion, celery, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cook and stir until 
              the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir in chicken stock, tomato sauce, sugar, hot pepper sauce, and 
              bay leaves. Reduce heat to low and bring sauce to a simmer. 
              Stir in seasoning mix and simmer until the flavors have blended, 
              about 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>Gently stir in rock shrimp, bay scallops, and haddock; bring 
              sauce back to a simmer and cook until the shellfish and fish 
              are opaque, about 20 more minutes. Remove bay leaves to serve.</li>
       </ol>

     <h5>Note</h5>
       <p>Due to the seasoning mix, it is quite spicy. This can be controlled by 
           adjusting the amount of the peppers. This recipe is full strength, but 
           for those who want it less spicy you can cut the peppers down to 
           1/8 teaspoon each. This recipe can easily be doubled or quadrupled for 
           large affairs. It goes great with rice, garlic bread, a green salad 
           and a good white wine, such as white Merlot, white Cabernet, 
           Johannisburg Riesling, or Gewurztraminer. Use your favorite firm, 
           white fish fillets in this recipe. Canned diced tomatoes can be 
           used in place of chopping fresh tomatoes. </p>

1st Odin Project: Recipes

This is the first project to do from TOP. This website will be a main index page with links to a few recipes.

  Things I hope to practice are:
  - Organizing project folders, pages and directories
  - Basic HTML code (lists, paragraphs, links)
  - Git workflow [staging (git add), commits (git commit), pushes (git push origin main) to Github]
